      I am Sandipsinh Rathod, born and raised in India. As a kid, I was frequently asked what I want to become when I grow up?
      This might not be a question that was asked seriously, but I was serious about my answer, inspired by my father, who is
      civil engineer himself. I decided to become an engineer since grade/class 2 and as a kid I had huge interest in computers
      and mechanics.

      As I started exploring, it turns out that access to some information on computers then on mechanics, this brought a heavy
      tilt in interest towards computers. I do not have had any access to computers and very limited access internet due to its
      cost back in the time. I was not able to download a lot of apps and I spent the majority of the time with the same apps
      and used to explore the combination of options that settings provides.

      I used to wonder how the apps made money, this made me to explore a lot and I found out that the Google's Admob was just
      based on just a few IDs, and if we somehow change the IDs with our own, we will be paid to use the app.

      This made me reverse engineer apps since the early age of 12. I successfully replaced the Admob ID of the apps which I
      frequently used. But one day my Admob account was banned, which I later found out that it was illegal to self click on ads
      and generate self impressions.

      This motivated me to create my own app. I had no means learn to build an app, so I just continued to reverse engineer apps
      and try to interpret the reversed code and try to build similar functions of the app from scratch (block code) then try
      to interpret the code generated from the scratch.

      I finally got my own laptop at the age of 13 with a lot of pre imposed restrictions. I explored app development whenever
      I could. This helped me develop skills in writing Java code and how to organise things and the flow of android app. Augmented
      Reality (AR) was relatively new concept for high level developers (App/Game developers) back in 2016/17, I developed an AR
      based game which spawned dinosaur/helicopter/car models or one can play a simple game of guessing the card from a deck of
      cards.

      I finally published 2 apps at the age of 16, from which one hit 13k+ downloads and had 10k+ active users in 3 months.
      But unfortunately, I had to take down the apps due to some of the restrictions imposed by parents for better academic
      performance.

      After scoring 90+% in Mathematics and Science in grade 10 and due to Corona period, I spend the majority of time on my laptop,
      this exponentially increased my learning speed.

      Due to inactivity my Google play console account got banned, so it allowed me to explore new topics, in the grade 11 (2 years ago)
      I created an opensource NoSQL Database which greatly enhanced my knowledge in IOT (such as WS, HTTP, Cryptography, etc),
      this lead me to create a modified version of org.json dependency and my previous knowledge of app development and multithreading
      helped me in testing, enhancing and expanding the server and it's dependencies. I published my first dependency on Maven,
      which is a challenging task in itself (due to lack in documentation and specific version of java required to publish it).

      During this time I used to hop on several Linux distros, and back and forth to windows as I had slow HDD and low ram to run
      IDEs like Idea and Android Studio. But there were instances where I needed some other OS to run the program, this introduced
      me to the concept of VM. However, after using VMs for some time, I got to know about Kernel based VMs (KVM) which gave almost
      native performance (which was used by android studio to run virtual machine).

      KVM was so interesting that I hopped on different OS and tried to run some other stuff on that OS by installing KVM in the OS.
      Setting up KVM on different OS brought new challenges, and some OS lack some drivers, others miss some functionality, fixing
      those excited me a lot. I always wanted to try MacOS and build some iOS app. After spending a lot of time, I was finally
      able to set up MacOS KVM on Manjaro (unlike hackintosh, this was legal and a common practice among the cloud providers).
      Again, I tried several combinations, i.e. installed MacOS on Ubuntu, Windows's WSL's Ubuntu, etc.

      On the programming part, I love exploring mathematically inclined topics in Computer Science.

      Due to poor performance of the DB, I switched to Rust, and after some time I realised my DB was a very puny and need to
      do something extraordinary to make it stand out, and I'm still gathering information and enhancing my skills for the same.

      During that time, I implemented several Cryptographic algorithms in rust, like RSA, DH, AES(CBC), XChaCha20 and learnt about
      TLS and how it works.

      Currently, I'm working on a 32 bit "unknown" processor which was created by some video game company and there is no reference
      or datasheet for the same, I'm trying several combinations that can possibly allow me to control the processor as I want,
      first of all I'm trying to reverse engineer its firmware or find some way that I can execute some code on it, which will
      allow me to control as I want. I'm planning to use it in a Remotely controlled (via internet) car with gears.

      I always set goals that I think are impossible for me to achieve currently, for example in the car, I'm planning that it
      must hit at least 100 km/h speed and for that, I'm planning to use some gear transmission, but using existing gear transmission
      systems are very challenging to implement in a compact car. I'm trying to invent some gear transmission that fit my case.
      On the electrical side, I have very basic idea of the circuits from the syllabus of a CSE student, but that is not enough
      for the project. Overall I'd have to explore in all possible areas and push my limits in order to achieve every tiny project
      that I think of.
